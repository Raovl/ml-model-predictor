# Language Model Power Predictor

## Overview

The Language Model Power Predictor is a machine learning model that predicts the power of language models based on their parameters. This project aims to analyze the performance of various language models and provide insights into their capabilities.

## Motivation

Language models have become increasingly important in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Understanding the power and limitations of different language models is crucial for effectively utilizing them in various applications.

## Features

- Predicts the power of language models based on their parameters.
- Analyzes the performance of various language models using machine learning techniques.
- Provides insights into the behavior and characteristics of language models.
- Enables comparison and evaluation of different language models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-model-power-predictor.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd language-model-power-predictor
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the language model power predictor.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook language_model_power_predictor.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains information about various language models, including their parameters, tokens, ALScores, training datasets, release dates, and additional notes. The dataset is provided in the `data/` directory
